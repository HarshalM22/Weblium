# 🛠️ AI-Powered Website Builder (React + Node.js)

This project is a modern AI-powered website builder that transforms natural language prompts into fully functional websites. Built using React, TypeScript, and a custom backend, it allows users to describe a website idea and instantly view a step-by-step build process, code preview, and live rendered result — all in a sleek, dark-themed interface.

## 💡 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a seamless, intuitive way for users — both technical and non-technical — to generate websites using simple text prompts. Whether you're describing a portfolio, a blog, or a marketing site, the builder translates your vision into real code and a functional preview in seconds.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Prompt-to-Website Flow**: Users input a text prompt describing their website (e.g., "a dark-themed portfolio with an about section and contact form"), and the builder generates the corresponding website code structure.
- **Build Steps Timeline**: A visual timeline shows the progress of each generation step (e.g., analyzing prompt, creating file structure, generating components).
- **Code Explorer**: A file explorer sidebar displays the full generated project file tree, including folders and files such as HTML, JSX, CSS, and configuration files.
- **Tabbed Interface**: Users can open multiple files as tabs, similar to a code editor, and switch between them to inspect different parts of the generated site.
- **Live Preview**: A real-time preview renders the output of the generated code, providing immediate feedback on what the final website will look like.
- **Dark Mode UI**: The entire interface features a clean, dark aesthetic with modern UI components, animations, and smooth transitions.

## 🚧 Project Status

This is an active work-in-progress. Future improvements will include:
- Support for multiple themes (light/dark)
- Code Preview 
- Exporting projects as downloadable ZIPs or GitHub repositories
- Drag-and-drop UI editing and customization
- Real-time collaborative editing

## 📌 Summary

This AI Website Builder bridges the gap between imagination and implementation. By leveraging natural language understanding and automated code generation, it transforms the traditional web development workflow into a smooth, prompt-driven experience.
